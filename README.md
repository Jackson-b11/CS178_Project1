## Overview of Project 1
You will build a self-contained web application using Flask that connects to both a relational (SQL via AWS RDS) and a non-relational (NoSQL via AWS DynamoDB) database. [More found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KcldyOEqKJrbJXvPy1aujHrb5jhhmeaMDVR5r-9wXqk/edit?tab=t.0)



## Features
